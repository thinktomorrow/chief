# Changelog

All Notable changes to the `chief` application template will be documented in this file. Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/)
principles.

## unreleased

## 0.7.9 - 2022-07-25
- Fixed: issue where removing diacritics in url removed entire url entry e.g. foobÃ©r => foobar.
- Fixed: issue where ordering nested fragments gave an error.

## 0.7.8 - 2022-06-15
- Fixed: issue where deleting model redirected to the index inside the sidebar.

## 0.7.7 - 2022-05-17
- Fixed: issue where deleting model redirected to the index inside the sidebar.
- Fixed: stay in sidebar if redirect is set for a fragment. By default a fragment with nested fragments redirects after creation to its edit page.
- Fixed: issue where file previews didn't show the original image while queue was still processing conversions.

## 0.7.6 - 2022-05-11
- Added: Simple state to use when your model only needs: online, offline and delete states. Add the `UsesSimpleState` trait.

## 0.7.5 - 2022-05-10
- Added: PageChanged event that can notify of any changed pages. Can be used for breaking cache.

## 0.7.4 - 2022-05-09
- Fixed: Filter presets where page state enum was used as option key.
- Fixed: Toast on error page fetches invalid url.
- Added: `StateAdminConfig::getTransitionFields` so you can add form fields that need to be filled in when changing state

## 0.7.2 - 2022-04-29
- Fixed: preventing double submits when clicking fast on fragment create
- Added: allow for developer to disable field require validation. Add the `CHIEF_DISABLE_FIELD_REQUIRED_VALIDATION=true` to your .env
- Added: easier way to add custom state config. This allows for easier custom state flows in projects.
- Changed: Resource keys must be unique. Trying to register a duplicate resource now halts registration.
- Removed: StatusAssistant. If you have added this trait in your project, replace it with the new `StateAssistant`.

## 0.7.1 - 2022-04-21
- Fixed: dashed squanto files are now displayed in admin without dash. This also fixes an issue with not showing translations when using dashed filenames.
- Fixed: Preview layout of images and grid.
- Added: Nested repeats. Now a repeat field can contain a repeat field itself.
- Added: A resource can set a custom `SaveFields` class.

## 0.7.0 - 2022-04-08
This release brings a major refactor of the forms and fields api. Its aim is to ease the layout setup of admin forms and simplify the logic around its view composition.

### Impactful
- Menu items has been optimized for performance. After migrations you should run `php artisan chief:project-menu`. This will project model data on each menuitem.
- Removed: extract dynamic fields based on field definitions.
- Removed: chiefRegister()->model() is removed. Use chiefRegister()->resource().
- Changed: Each viewable model needs to have a `viewKey()` method to determine the frontend view path.
- Changed: Nav tags are no longer added via the register method, chiefRegister()->resource(). Instead on the page resource you should set the `protected function getNavTags(): array` method to provide the nav tags.
- Changed: chief admin toast is no longer accessible via `chief::site.admin-toast`. It should now be referred to via: `chief-site::admin-toast`.

- Changed: Restructured Fields files and classes under a dedicated `src/Forms` directory. Rename all your field namespaces from `Thinktomorrow\Chief\ManagedModels\Fields\Types\<Field>` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\<Field>`.
- Removed: field method `customSaveMethod`. Replace any occurrences with the save() method. See below.
- Removed: magic model methods for saving a field. Replace any `save<FIELDKEY>Field()` and `save<FIELDTYPE>Fields()` methods on your model. View next item how to do this:
- Changed: Because these methods are removed, A custom save for a field can now only be set via a Closure passed via the Field::save(Closure) method. e.g. Field::save(fn($model, $field, $input, $files) => $this->customSave())
- Changed: `InputField` is renamed to `TextInput`.
- Changed: Field rules method only accepts an array. A pipe separated string is no longer valid, e.g. email|max:100 should now be passed as ['email','max:100].
- Changed: `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\FieldsComponentAssistant` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\FormsAssistant`.
- Removed: custom sidebar form views are removed. These are the methods ending with `*FieldsAdminView()`. You can now add a custom view to a form instead.
- Removed: `selected()` method for option fields such as select, checkbox or radio. Use `value()` instead.
- Removed: `notOnCreate()` method. Use `tag('not-on-create')` instead.
- Removed: Fragment views no longer have owner specific view paths. Fragment has only one view. Less magic.

### Keep an eye out for possible impact
- Changed: Validation of localized fields will now validate each localized entry. Before if an entire locale entry array was empty, it was regarded as a request input and the validation on these locales would get skipped. This is no longer the case.
- Changed: If you set required on localized field, every locale is required. To only require the default language, you can use a special designed validation rule called `requiredFallbackLocale`.
- Changed: Namespace of Media classes has been moved from `Thinktomorrow\Chief\ManagedModels\Media` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\Media`.

### Probably not so impactful
- Changed: `Field::getColumn()` has been renamed to `Field::getColumnName()`.
- Changed: `Field::required()` has been renamed to `Field::isRequired()`.
- Changed: `fields-edit` route to `form-edit`.
- Changed: `fields-update` route to `form-update`.
- Removed: `saveFields` is removed from the ManagedModel interface. Saving fields is done via a dedicated class and no longer via the model->saveFields() method.
- Removed: `Field::optional()`
- Removed: `Field::getType()`.
- Removed: The FieldType class and all its definitions which are not useful in the new setup.
