# Changelog

All notable changes to the `chief` application template will be documented in this file. Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/)
principles.

## Unreleased
Major refactor and improvement of the file asset management. 
Upload, additions, deletions and sorting of files per page is more user-friendly.
An asset can be edited and can contain textual fields.
All assets can be managed via the asset index.

The Slim script is replaced by a custom livewire solution. This resulted in less code complexity and easier upload handling. 

-   Removed `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\Media\MediaType` as a legacy reference to predefined file keys. 
-   Removed `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\Media\FileDTO` since now `Thinktomorrow\AssetLibrary\Asset` is passed to file field instead. 
-   Removed `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\FileUploadAssistant`, `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\SlimImageUploadAssistant` and `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\RedactorFileUploadAssistant`. These are no longer used and replaced by the Livewire FileComponent upload logic. The latter one was no longer actively used.

## 0.7.0 - 2022-04-08

This release brings a major refactor of the forms and fields api. Its aim is to ease the layout setup of admin forms and simplify the logic around its view composition.

### Impactful

-   Menu items has been optimized for performance. After migrations you should run `php artisan chief:project-menu`. This will project model data on each menuitem.
-   Removed: extract dynamic fields based on field definitions.
-   Removed: chiefRegister()->model() is removed. Use chiefRegister()->resource().
-   Changed: Each viewable model needs to have a `viewKey()` method to determine the frontend view path.
-   Changed: Nav tags are no longer added via the register method, chiefRegister()->resource(). Instead on the page resource you should set the `protected function getNavTags(): array` method to provide the nav tags.
-   Changed: chief admin toast is no longer accessible via `chief::site.admin-toast`. It should now be referred to via: `chief-site::admin-toast`.

-   Changed: Restructured Fields files and classes under a dedicated `src/Forms` directory. Rename all your field namespaces from `Thinktomorrow\Chief\ManagedModels\Fields\Types\<Field>` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\<Field>`.
-   Removed: field method `customSaveMethod`. Replace any occurrences with the save() method. See below.
-   Removed: magic model methods for saving a field. Replace any `save<FIELDKEY>Field()` and `save<FIELDTYPE>Fields()` methods on your model. View next item how to do this:
-   Changed: Because these methods are removed, A custom save for a field can now only be set via a Closure passed via the Field::save(Closure) method. e.g. Field::save(fn($model, $field, $input, $files) => $this->customSave())
-   Changed: `InputField` is renamed to `TextInput`.
-   Changed: Field rules method only accepts an array. A pipe separated string is no longer valid, e.g. email|max:100 should now be passed as ['email','max:100].
-   Changed: `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\FieldsComponentAssistant` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Managers\Assistants\FormsAssistant`.
-   Removed: custom sidebar form views are removed. These are the methods ending with `*FieldsAdminView()`. You can now add a custom view to a form instead.
-   Removed: `selected()` method for option fields such as select, checkbox or radio. Use `value()` instead.
-   Removed: `notOnCreate()` method. Use `tag('not-on-create')` instead.
-   Removed: Fragment views no longer have owner specific view paths. Fragment has only one view. Less magic.

### Keep an eye out for possible impact

-   Changed: Validation of localized fields will now validate each localized entry. Before if an entire locale entry array was empty, it was regarded as a request input and the validation on these locales would get skipped. This is no longer the case.
-   Changed: If you set required on localized field, every locale is required. To only require the default language, you can use a special designed validation rule called `requiredFallbackLocale`.
-   Changed: Namespace of Media classes has been moved from `Thinktomorrow\Chief\ManagedModels\Media` to `Thinktomorrow\Chief\Forms\Fields\Media`.

### Probably not so impactful

-   Changed: `Field::getColumn()` has been renamed to `Field::getColumnName()`.
-   Changed: `Field::required()` has been renamed to `Field::isRequired()`.
-   Changed: `fields-edit` route to `form-edit`.
-   Changed: `fields-update` route to `form-update`.
-   Removed: `saveFields` is removed from the ManagedModel interface. Saving fields is done via a dedicated class and no longer via the model->saveFields() method.
-   Removed: `Field::optional()`
-   Removed: `Field::getType()`.
-   Removed: The FieldType class and all its definitions which are not useful in the new setup.
