set preferred site by default
set preferred site via chief toast
set preferred site via site toggle in chief nav

this sets:

- table filters to this site
- locale tabs to respective site locale
- shows context/menu for which active site is selected

Setting admin locale is a different thing and can be set via users > preferences (dream on)
